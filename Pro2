to find number of networks can be formed without overlapping and should be having atleast minComps and more than threshold speed

def func(speeds,minComps,speedThreshold):
    n=len(speeds)
    totalComs=0
    totalThresh=0
    res=0
    i=0
    while(i<n):
        
        for j in range(i,n):
            totalComs+=1
            totalThresh+=speeds[j]
            if(totalThresh>speedThreshold) and (totalComs>minComps):
                res+=1
                break;
            j+=1
        i=j+1
        totalComs=0
        totalThresh=0
    return res    

s=[5, 7, 9, 12, 10, 13]
minComps=2
speedThreshold=15
print(func(s,minComps,speedThreshold))
