 The function accept positive integer n and num Implement the function to calculate the
 n-base equivalent of num and return the same as a string
 Steps:
 1. Divide the decimal number by n, Treat the division as the integer division
 2. Write the the remainder (in n-base notation)
 3. Divide the quotient again by n, Treat the division as integer division
 4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until the quotient is 0
 5. The n-base value is the sequence of the remainders from last to first


def func(n,num):
    b=[]
    a=num
    while(a!=0):
        rem=a%n
        a=a//n
        b.append(rem)

    b=b[::-1]
    equ=''
    for i in b:
        if i >9:
            c=i-9
            c=64+c
            equ+=chr(c)
        else:
            equ+=str(i)
    return equ
n= 12
num= 718
print(func(n,num))
