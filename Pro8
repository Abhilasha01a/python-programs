 The function accepts a string ‘ str’ of length n and two characters ‘ch1’ and ‘ch2’ as its
 arguments . Implement the function to modify and return the string ‘ str’ in such a way that
 all occurrences of ‘ch1’ in original string are replaced by ‘ch2’ and all occurrences of ‘ch2’
 in original string are replaced by ‘ch1’.
 Assumption: String Contains only lower-case alphabetical letters.
 Note:
 ● Return null if string is null.
 ● If both characters are not present in string or both of them are same , then return the
 string unchanged.

def func(str1,s1,s2):
    if(str1!=None):
        str=str1.replace(s1,'*').replace(s2,s1).replace('*',s2)
    return str        

string1="apples"
s1='a'
s2='p'
print(func(string1,s1,s2))
